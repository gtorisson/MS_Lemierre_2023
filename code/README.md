There are four scripts:
- functions.R - custom functions
- main_script.R - the main script for the project
- plots.R - script for all plots, including supplemental
- output.R - script for pdf output for plots to be included in paper

If the code is not run from the markdown file it needs to be run in the following sequence:
1. functions.R
2. main_script.R
3. plots.R
4. output.R
